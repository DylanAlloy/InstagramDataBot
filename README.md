# InstagramDataBot
I wrote a script that miserably hacks the instagram page of a user and parses data after cleaning it up and using lists. I will come up with a better way to do it but Instagram really does not want bots scraping their site, I've found out. This records follower count specifically without using the Instagram API. This makes it ridiculously easy to gather important info quickly for an up-and-coming brand. 

# Use
This is for gathering data about how many followers you gain in a certain period. Over time I may add more features but probably only if I find a better way to do this (there is one).
It saves your data in an x,y array with a colon ( : ) as a delimiter. On the right is the exact date and time canonically, and on the left is the number of followers.

Every interval(whatever you set it at), there will be a small digit on the bottom of the readout. Something like 341. This is normal and this is the index of the information being cleaned.
If this changes, something about Instagram has changed and the bot is most likely no longer functioning properly until I play catch up.
